# Titanic-Survivor-Prediction

This project tackles the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster challenge by predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning models including Random Forest and AdaBoost classifiers.

# Project Overview 

Using historical data from the Titanic's manifest, this project:

    Cleans and preprocesses the data (handles missing values, extracts useful features)

    Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns in survival rates

    Creates new features such as title extraction, family size, and fare per person

    Applies encoding and scaling techniques for machine learning compatibility

    Builds and optimizes machine learning models to predict passenger survival

    Visualizes survival rates by class and fare to interpret model behavior

# Used Methods

Python

Pandas, NumPy — data manipulation

Seaborn, Matplotlib — data visualization

scikit-learn — model building, training, hyperparameter tuning

# What I learned 

How to clean and preprocess real-world data

The importance of thoughtful feature engineering

Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

Visualizing patterns that influence model predictions
